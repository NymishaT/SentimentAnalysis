    "# that this sentence has a negative sentiment. This is due to it also looking at the words in the sentence \n",
    "# in pairs as well as individually. It would see 'not love' and understand that this is a negative response\n",
    "# because of the negation word ('not') appearing before a positive word ('love').\n",
    "\n",
    "# For my case, it would be the issue of reviews that might have had a negation word before a positive word\n",
    "# would have been classified incorrectly as positive instead of negative and vice versa. Using bigrams \n",
    "# along with unigrams would prevent this issue and the expected result would be an increase in the\n",
